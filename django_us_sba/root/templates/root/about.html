        <p class="mb-4">Welcome to our site dedicated to assisting the Small Business Administration (SBA) in making informed decisions regarding loan guarantees for clients of third-party banks.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Our mission is to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze historical loan data and provide predictive insights to the SBA. By doing so, we aim to streamline the loan approval process, ensuring that small businesses receive the financial support they need to thrive.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We collect and preprocess historical loan data, extracting key features that influence loan approval decisions. Our machine learning models analyze this data to predict whether the SBA should guarantee a loan for a given borrower from a third-party bank. These predictions are based on patterns and trends observed in past loan outcomes.</p>
